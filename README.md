# Horiseon Challenge Assignment

## Description
The original html code for the index.html file had a few issues in terms of accesibility standards and logical flow of HTML. With a bit of editing to the html tags, I changed the index.html to follow the accesibility standards. In the process I added alt attributes to the images shown on the webpage. I also added a concise title, and commented all of the changes made in the index.html and style.css files. 

Full list of changes made to index.html:
* Added title to webpage
* Changed all non semantic HTML elements to semantic HTML elements (div -> section or article, span ->strong)
* Added alt tags for all images on the page
* Reordered heading elements to follow sequential order
* Renamed the necessary class selectors in style.css to match the new semantic HTML tags 
* Changed the class selector to id selector for the navigation bar at the top of the webpage to ensure link functionality
* Renamed the footer h4 class selector to match the sequential order on index.html
