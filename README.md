# Horiseon Challenge Assignment

## Description
The original html code for the index.html file had a few issues in terms of accesibility standards and logical flow of HTML. With a bit of editing to the html tags, I changed the index.html to follow the accesibility standards. In the process I added alt attributes to the images shown on the webpage. I also added a concise title, and commented all of the changes made in the index.html and style.css files. 

Full list of changes made to index.html:
* Added title to webpage
